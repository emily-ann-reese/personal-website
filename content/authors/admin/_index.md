Hi! My name is Emily Reese. I'm in my third year at the University of Akron studying economics with a minor in philosophy. I'm interested in statistics and economics and their applications in econometrics and data analysis. 

I use this website to catalog code, keep track of notes and papers, blog, and a wide variety of other things. Obviously feel free to explore!

NOTE: I am currently making some changes as of 3/24/2022 and most pages are placeholders until I am ready to make additional changes.
