Hi! My name is Emily Reese. I'm a recent graduate of The University of Akron with my bachelors of arts in economics.  

I plan on using this website to catalog code, keep track of notes and papers, blog, and a wide variety of other things. Obviously feel free to explore!

NOTE: I am currently making some changes as of 09/24/2024 and most pages are placeholders until I am ready to make additional changes.
